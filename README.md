# Smoking Trends Analysis

## **Project Overview**
This project is a data analysis of smoking trends aimed at exploring patterns, correlations, and key insights from the dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to highlight trends and provide actionable insights. This repository serves as a demonstration of data analysis and visualization techniques using Python.

## **Features**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of trends and patterns
- Insights and conclusions derived from the data

## **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python**: Primary programming language for analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code, markdown, and visualizations.
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - Additional libraries as required

## **Dataset**
- The dataset used in this project is included in the `data/` directory (if permitted to share).
- If the dataset cannot be provided, ensure you update the data path in the notebook and follow the instructions in the `README` to acquire the data independently.


## **Visualizations**
Key visualizations included in this analysis:
- Distribution of smokers across demographics
- Trends in smoking habits over time
- Correlations between smoking and other factors (e.g., health metrics, geography)

## **Key Insights**
- Highlight some key findings (replace placeholders):
  - Insight 1: Example of smoking trend across age groups.
  - Insight 2: Correlation between smoking frequency and health outcomes.
  - Insight 3: Impact of geography on smoking trends.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Expand the analysis with machine learning predictions.
- Include more datasets for a comprehensive view.
- Automate the pipeline for repeated analyses.
